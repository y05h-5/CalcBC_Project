# CalcBC_Project
Codes I used for calculating the points on the graphs for international CAD project in my Calc BC class. Programmed in C.


Graph of two formulas within the domain I set: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/w5dqwm0tgj
Which looks like this.

I wrote codes for 1) x-values, 2) first formula and 3) second formula. Then I copied and pasted the results on google spreadsheet, and then exported the XYZ values in .csv file, which I directly imported to Fusion360.




Then I revolved the plotted graph around y â‰ˆ 0.3788, because that is where Fusion360 doesn't give the solids-overlapping error.
